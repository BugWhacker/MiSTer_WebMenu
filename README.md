## Project Status

The project is in early alpha, the implemented features should work for standard MiSTer setups, but the code is far from being optimal.

I am not accepting new code pull requests at this stage, but I'd appreciate if you can:

- Test it!  If something is not working properly, please open an [issue](https://github.com/nilp0inter/MiSTer_WebMenu/issues).
- Contribute your ideas about new features.
- Give your feedback. Do you like it? Hate it? Open an issue or send me a tweet ([@nilp0inter](https://twitter.com/nilp0inter))

2. Start your MiSTer, go to **Scripts** and launch `webmenu`.
